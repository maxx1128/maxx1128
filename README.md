# I'm Max Antonucci

* I'm a front-end engineer focusing on accessibility, and currently working at [AgileSix](https://agile6.com/).
* [I've got a blog where I write about code, lessons, books, and random musings](https://www.maxwellantonucci.com/).
* My hobbies are reading, writing, drawing, crafting, and a little gaming.
* I'm not a lizard person. I can confirm this as of the end of 2018.
