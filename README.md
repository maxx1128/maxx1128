# I'm Max Antonucci

* I'm a front-end engineer focusing on accessibility, and currently working at [SeeClickFix](https://seeclickfix.com/).
* [I've got a blog where I write about code, lessons, books, and random musings](https://www.maxwellantonucci.com/).
* My hobbies are reading, writing, gaming, and making anything I can think of with anime artwork. For example, the below image with [my little quotemaker](https://www.quotemaker.maxwellantonucci.com/).
* I'm not a lizard person. I can confirm this as of the end of 2018.
